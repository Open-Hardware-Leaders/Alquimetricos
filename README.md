# Alquimetricos Connectors

Alquimétricos DIY flexible connectors are a simple but powerfull STEAM educational resource targeted specially for vulnerable communities
A simple set of hexagon and pentagon pieces allows to build geodesic structures any anything else you can imagine.

## Zero cost STEAM toys
Alquimétricos is a collection of open source didactic toys: building blocks to mount structures and learn-while-playing about geometry, maths, architecture, mechanics, physics, chemistry, and much more. The initiative is focused on the design of DIY educational materials which are meant to be produced using a wide range of procedures, from ultra-low-cost-low-tech tool set (scissors and nails) to high-end-FabLab-standards (laser cutter, CNC milling, 3D printing), using an equally wide ranged material sort, including recycled packaging plastics, rubbers, cloths and cardboard composites throughout textile-embedded polymers, organic fibers or even lab-harvested fungus. Alquimétricos are meant to play, learn and share.

## Quality didactic toys should be free for the children and the planet
The objective is to awaken the reflection on consumerism and programmed obsolescence and to freely disponibilize a game-change educational resource (such as tech building blocks) on communities that cannot afford a box of LEGO or KNEX.

## A different building blocks approach
It's flexible nature provides an interesting structural twist, allowing the same piece to work as a hub as well as an articulation, depending on the configuration you choose.

You can produce them out of recycled materials like milk box cardboard, bike or car inner tire tube, leather, textiles, PCV publicity banners and more. Or use rubbers like EVA or latex, silicones, cork composites.
Use laser cutters, plotter, CNC or 3D printer if you have access to digital fabrication machinery, or simply handcraft them with scisors and punch hole pliers.


## Open. Really
Our product blueprints, educational materials, comercial/sustainability and branding models are open. Feel free to download, hack, remix, share, create content, make your living out of Alquimétricos products and services, if you want to.

With the aid of a growing community of collaborators, maker and artist Fernando Daguanno develops products, workshops, classroom guides, tutorials other educational resources to help spread these open techs not only among children but through teachers, art-educators and key community leaders, under a sustainable social and environmental perspective. Based on this horizontal, multi-directional and multi-layered knowledge exchange experiences, he conducts exhibitions, performances and collective interventions using and distributing these methodologies to create building blocks sets usually out of range for most of the participants. The goal is to generate collective creation happenings under a learn-by-doing and learn-by-playing logic.

## A simple starting point for something huge
Alquimétricos is diving into didactic robotics waters through the integration of arduino-like controllers mixed with recycled tech. Alquibots are robotic kits meant to experiment with electronics, kinetic sculpture, sound and movement. Alquimétricos combines a multiplicity of arts and technologies to stimulate the integrated development and sensory, logical and expressive experimentation. Though, community develops a wide variety of open educational contents, documented and ready to be downloaded, hacked and shared.

## Glocally ready
The vision of the initiative includes local production, exponential development and global scope, levering on viralyzing opportunities to become a simple solution for two big problems of the consumer society: the excess of what’s usually called trash and the lack of educative programs focused on low-tech as an economic, social, personal and collective development instrument.
